EVENTFUL CAKEPHP
==============================
Event System for CakePHP

Installation:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Put "events" to APP
- Put "plugins/eventful" to APP.PLUGINS
- Add "Eventful.Event" to AppController::$components
- Optional: Add "Eventful.Event" to AppModel::$actsAs array

Current Version:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Behavior not tested.. should work, copied from draft.
- Need to add default triggers for controller (onBeforeFilter, etc.)

How to use:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Listener classes need to have the same name as the controller file + "_events" at
the end. So if you want to write event handlers for "movies_controller.php" you need 
to create a file called "movies_controller_events.php" in the folder /app/events/controllers/.
Same goes for models. The matching "user.php" event class filename is "user_events.php".

Note: Just because you are dispatching events from one controller it is not required 
that the listener class file exists. 

Withing the listener classes you need to prefix your event handler methods with 
the "on" keyword. If you dispatch a event called "userSignUp" like so:

<?php 
	$this->Event->dispatch('userSignUp') 
?>

The method within the class needs to be named "onUserSignUp". More specific:

<?php
	// users_controller_events.php
	class UsersControllerEvents extends AppControllerEvents {
	
		function onUserSignUp($event) {
			// ... do stuff.
		}	
	}
?>

As you can see, we extend the AppControllerEvents class. This class is of same 
nature as the app_controller.php. It is the default base class for all events. 
We also have AppModelEvents for model events.

You can overwrite the AppControllerEvents class by creating the file
"app_controller_events.php" in the APP folder. Same spot as app_helper.php, etc.
But that's optional... a good place for shared events.

About the "$event" parameter. Passed to all handlers by default. If the event 
is a controller event you can access the controller object at $event->Controller.
If the event is a model event you can access the model at $event->Model.

There is also a optional $data parameter in the EventComponent dispatch method.

<?php
	$this->Event->dispatch('userSignUp', array('hello' => 'kitty'));
?>

The event handler method can access the value of "hello" at the event object

<?php
	class UsersControllerEvents extends AppControllerEvents {
	
		function onUserSignUp($event) {
			return $event->hello; //=> kitty
		}
	}
?>

That should get you started.
